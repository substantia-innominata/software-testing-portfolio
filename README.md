10 points


## Subtask 3

I've decided to take part in this project to test my knowledge and abilities in practice.

I would like to gain more experience in software testing and acquire more advanced skills. I need to increase my chances of getting a job in IT within the next year :)

#### PURPOSE AND FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE WEB APP

This app has been designed to store and explore data about football players concerning their ratings, positions, performance/skills etc.

I would distinguish browsing in database with players’ performance details as main functionality, including data for matches and reports.

On that basis, I would discriminate other sub-functionalities including adding and editing: players, matches and reports.

Other sub-functionalities unrelated to data editing would be:
- downloading, printing and filtering data;
- contact with development team;
- changing the language.

UI design is simple - I assume that this type of application doesn’t have to be eye-catching as it is used mostly for storing some data. It is clear and easy to navigate.

#### INCONVENIENCES & PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS

- taking into consideration security issues, I would suggest implementing automatic logout for long-term inactivity;
- there are some typos, e.g. Aktywnosć, zaaktualizowany;
- there are some inconsistencies in language - e.g. Filter table in Polish mode shows labels both in Polish and English (Imię, Nazwisko, Age, Pozycja, Klub, Rate);
- errors should be more informative - e.g. there may be information about lack of @ in email address instead of a vague note 'Cannot add player';
- the tables may be more readable if contrast is used (e.g. zebra stripes effect);
- using *input* tags inside *form* tag (instead *div*) would make HTML structure more semantic;
- in Slow 3G mode it takes almost a minute (57.78 s) to render Players Table (it takes about 25 s in Fast 3G mode) - it may be uncomfortable to operate for users;
- comment concerning RWD issue: in mobile mode the tables with data for Matches and Reports are still presented horizontally - users are not accustomed to scrolling form left to right (it may be more convenient to present the table vertically as it takes place in case of Players table);
- database search may be more convenient if there is pagination with buttons to navigate to first and last pages with a table;
- I haven’t found info where data for Events list comes from - it is just visible in a table but there is no place to add or edit this information in Edit Match Player form;
- there are no general databases for Matches, Reports and Events - they are just listed as inactive boxes with numbers - I have expected them to be presented e.g. as a table with data, similar to the database with Players details; the only reports and matches statistics I found are these redirected from Last updated report and they concern only one player;
- there is no information about the position of newly added player (I couldn’t find it in the table without filters searching).

#### BUGS
- ADD REPORT button doesn’t show a form to complete - it redirects the user to Matches table;
- there is no possibility to reach the final page of Players table - at some point it is stopped and cut into first column;
- data in columns Matches and Reports is transformed into [object Object] instead of numbers;
- column age in csv file shows date of birth instead of actual player’s age.


NOTE: This evaluation if far from ideal, but I stick to opinion that done is better than perfect :)
